;; Commentary:
;;    Work on something. Focus, get it done. Clock's ticking.
;;
;;    This is a set of hooks wrapped around a simple state machine and timer.
;;    The minutes remaining for the current task (or break) appear on
;;    the modeline.
;;
;;    For typical usage, just run zwiebel-dwim (which will run zwiebel-start,
;;    zwiebel-interrupt, or zwiebel-break, depending on the current state).
;;    You'll probably want to give it a global keybinding, such as
;;        (global-set-key (kbd "C-c z") 'zwiebel-dwim) .
;;
;;    Register events with the hooks for notifications, logging, etc.
;;        (add-hook 'zwiebel-complete-hook
;;           (message (format "Done: %s" *zwiebel-task*)))
;;
;;    I'd name this for the Tomato-in-Italian Technique, but it's trademarked.
;;
;;    For an autoload, use (autoload 'zwiebel-dwim "zwiebel" "" t).
;;
;; TODO:
;;    * Set up custom stuff. I never use custom, but hey.
;;    * Is there a better way to get the seconds remaining from a timer?
